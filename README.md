# 💫 About Me:
Hey there! 👋 I'm Nivethan Eswaran, currently immersed in my third year studying Electrical and Electronics Engineering (EEE), all while fueling my passion for both hardware and software development. Here's a glimpse into what keeps me busy:

🛠️ Constantly honing my skills as a Full Stack web developer, with a particular affinity for MERN stack projects.

🌐 Crafting intuitive and efficient web solutions is my forte, whether it's developing sleek user interfaces or optimizing server-side functionalities.

🤝 Seeking collaborations on exciting web development ventures that seamlessly integrate engineering principles with cutting-edge digital innovations.

🌱 Eagerly exploring advanced JavaScript frameworks like React.js to create dynamic and engaging user experiences.

💡 Currently delving into the intricacies of backend technologies such as Node.js and Express.js to build robust and scalable web applications.

🔍 On the lookout for opportunities to enhance my understanding of web accessibility and inclusive design practices, ensuring that my creations are usable by all.

💬 Feel free to strike up a conversation about blending engineering concepts with web development, or if you're curious about optimizing energy efficiency in electronic systems.

🎉 Fun Fact: I once pieced together a mini hydroelectric generator using spare parts salvaged from old electronics! ⚡️
